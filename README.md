# ELIMcollection
C++ examples of digital image processing.

## Introduction
This is a simple collection of OpenCV C++ examples found on the net or written by ourselves.
We hope those examples will help people understanding digital image processing.:v: :v:

All the code is in Italian language!:it:

## Requirements
You must install [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html) in order to compile files.

In each directory there is a *CMakeLists* file, so you have just to compile it.

Open folder in terminal and compile:
```bash
cmake .
make
```

## Collection
There is a *.pdf* file containing some most important arguments of digital image processing.

Our collection is composed by:

- Low Pass Filters
- High Pass Filters
- Histogram EQ
- Canny Edge Detection
- Harris Corner Detection
- Hough Lines
- Hough Circles
- Distance Transform
- Split and Merge
- Region Growing (B/W)
- Region Growing (Color)
- K-Means
- Background Subtraction
- Optical Flux
